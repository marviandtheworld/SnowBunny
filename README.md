# 🐇❄️ Bunny Snow Game Prototype

A small 3D Unity game prototype where a bunny skates through snowy terrain looking for carrots.  
This project helps me learn the **fundamentals of the Unity Editor** while exploring **VFX, Lighting, Animation, Audio, UI**, and **basic C# programming** in a **small, focused scope**.

---

## 🎯 **Project Goal**

- Make a tiny but complete 3D game within **2 weeks**.
- Focus on learning:
  - Unity Editor basics
  - Visual Effects (VFX)
  - Lighting and moods
  - Basic character Animation
  - Simple Audio triggers
  - User Interface (UI)
  - Clean, small C# scripts
- Practice version control with Git & GitHub.

---

## 🗂️ **Planned Features**

✅ A controllable bunny that can:
- Skate or slide on snow  
- Collect carrots

✅ A simple snowy terrain:
- Basic terrain tools
- Snow shader or particle effect

✅ Visual polish:
- Ambient light & shadows
- Simple skating VFX (snow trails, particles)

✅ UI:
- Carrot counter
- Start/Restart

✅ Audio:
- Skating sound
- Carrot pickup sound

✅ Tiny win state:
- Collect all carrots → show a victory screen.

## 📌 **Learning Pathway**

| Skill Area | Task |
|------------|------|
| 🗂️ Unity Editor | Organize project folders, learn inspector, prefabs |
| 🖌️ VFX | Snow trails, particles |
| 💡 Lighting | Simple day/night, snow lighting |
| 🎞️ Animation | Bunny idle, skating |
| 🔊 Audio | Footstep/slide sounds, carrot sound |
| 🖥️ UI | Counter, win text |
| ⚙️ Programming | Player movement, pickups, basic UI logic |

---

## ⏰ **Timeline**

- **Day 1-2**: Set up GitHub, Unity project, test terrain & player movement.
- **Day 3-5**: Add carrots, pickup logic, basic UI.
- **Day 6-8**: Add VFX, snow particles, lighting tweaks.
- **Day 9-11**: Add bunny animations, skating SFX.
- **Day 12-14**: Polish, test, fix, final commit.

---

## 🗒️ **Notes**

- Using **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** to practice basic shader/VFX.
- Keep it simple — no big systems or complicated mechanics.
- Commit often to GitHub to track progress.
